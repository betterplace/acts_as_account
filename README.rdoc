== Theory

ActsAsAccount implements a "Double Entry Accounting" system for your
Rails-models.

It hooks into ActiveRecord and allows to add accounts to any model by
simply means of adding "has_account" to your model. Because the accounts
are connected via a has_many relation no migration to the account-holder
tables is needed.

We also hook into the ActionController request cycle to warn the developer
if a request has left the uncommitted changes in the system.

== Support

Rails 4 is supported since version 3.1.0

== How to test

Run the cucumber features from the acs_as_account gem, just execute
* rake features:create_database
* cucumber

== Compatibility

With the release of version 2.0.0 acts_as_account is supposed to work for Rails 3. If you still use Rails 2 please use version 1.2.0.
